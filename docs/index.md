## What is GeneralsHub?

GeneralsHub is a sophisticated, multi-layered launcher designed to solve the fundamental problem of C&C Generals/Zero Hour ecosystem fragmentation. Since the game went open source, the community has released many forks and patched executables. GeneralsHub consolidates these variants into a single, unified interface.

## Key Features

- **Game Profile Management**: Create custom configurations combining base games with mods, patches, and add-ons
- **Three-Tier Content Pipeline**: A robust system for discovering, resolving, acquiring, and assembling content from multiple sources
- **Workspace Strategies**: Multiple file assembly approaches (Full Copy, Symlink, Hybrid, Hard Link) for optimal performance and compatibility
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Native Windows and Linux support with platform-specific optimizations
