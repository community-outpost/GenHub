- Dedicated workspaces for custom strategies  

---

## Feature Architecture

Each feature is designed as a **modular component** that can be used
independently or integrated with others. The architecture follows these
principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each feature handles a specific domain  
- **Dependency Injection**: Features are loosely coupled through DI  
- **Result Pattern**: Consistent error handling across all features  
- **Async/Await**: All operations support asynchronous execution  
- **Observable Progress**: Long-running operations provide progress updates  

---

## Integration Points

Features integrate through well-defined interfaces and shared models:

- **Result Pattern**: All features return structured results  
- **Progress Reporting**: `IProgress<T>` for operation status  
- **Cancellation**: `CancellationToken` support for all operations  
- **Logging**: Structured logging with `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`  
- **Configuration**: Unified configuration system (`IAppConfiguration`,`IUserSettingsService`, `IConfigurationProviderService`)

---

## Feature Categories

- **Installation & Setup**: Game installation detection, validation, and configuration  
- **Content Management**: Mods, patches, add-ons, and community content  
- **Profile Management**: Game profiles, workspaces, and custom configurations  
- **Launching & Execution**: Advanced launch options and runtime monitoring
